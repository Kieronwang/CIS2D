  These exercises were helpful in understanding when and why to use the different types of data structures in java and how to implement them. All of the data structures in java implement from the Collection Interface. 
  In the first exercise, I learned how to use the Collection Interface to manipulate and work with data. Using the asList method of the Arrays class, I can create a link between an array and a collection. I can then use the methods of the Collections class to search a list for the position of an element.
  Each collection in java has an Iterable Interface which helps to navigate a data structure. The Collection Interace extends the Iterable Interface and the ListIterate is used for list data structures. In the second exercise, I learned that with a collection object I can create an Iterator object with the iterator() method and this allows me to use the hasNext() method to create a while loop which will navigate through a collection as long as there is another element in the collection remaining each time through the loop. This can be used to print each element of the collection.
  I learned that ArrayLists are the most frequently used data structures and implementing them allows position reliant operations and allows addition or deletion from the ArrayList by position value. I learned a use for ArrayLists would be to allow quickly adding elements to any position in the ArrayList. So, ArrayLists are flexible with their size and allow easy insertion and deletion to a list of data.
